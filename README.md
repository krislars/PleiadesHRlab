## ASTRO 101 student lab making an HR diagram for the Pleiades star cluster

To see this page rendered via github pages, visit <https://krislars.github.io/pleiadesHRlab/>

The lab has two parts:
1. page where students [select stars and make observations](https://krislars.github.io/pleiadesHRlab/Pleiades.html) 
2. [Google sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q-FHZ0XBOFdSdVLwLBQKaTP9XjQjtGV9G_KCNwJGXc4/edit?usp=sharing) where students can plot their results

Pro tip for faculty: the standard sharing link for a google sheet looks like this:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q-FHZ0XBOFdSdVLwLBQKaTP9XjQjtGV9G_KCNwJGXc4/edit?usp=sharing

If you take out the "edit" and replace with "copy", like this:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q-FHZ0XBOFdSdVLwLBQKaTP9XjQjtGV9G_KCNwJGXc4/copy?usp=sharing

then Google will prompt the student to save a copy in their own Google drive.
