ASTRO 101 student lab making an HR diagram for the Pleiades star cluster

The lab has two parts:
1. page where students [select stars and make observations here](Pleiades.html) 
2. [Google sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q-FHZ0XBOFdSdVLwLBQKaTP9XjQjtGV9G_KCNwJGXc4/edit?usp=sharing) where students can plot their results
